            <h1>Hello, my name is Kamil,</h1> 
            <p>I am currently a master's degree student in Computer Science and Econometrics at the University of Gda≈Ñsk. I have completed my bachelor's degree in Mathematical Modeling and Data Analysis at the same university.</p>
            
            <p>I am Back-End Developer specializing in .NET and C#. I worked with this technology for business purposes and now I use .NET at "Study Buddy" startup (instagram.com/appstudybuddy). I'm also learning Front-End, but I don't feel proficient in this field yet.</p>
            
            <p>My main hobby is music - I play the alto and baritone saxophone, bass guitar and piano. I also love playing board games (especially chess), playing paper RPGs (D&D), solving Rubik's cubes and riding a bike around the world.</p>
